# Introduction to RL

We are not born with any knowledge we attain this knowledge by interacting with the world around us, when we interact with the world we learn about cause and effect and understand how the world responds to our actions. Once we understand how the world responds to our interaction we use this knowledge to attain specific goals. The real world is very complex so we create a learning environment with specific set of rules we make algorithms to tech agents in this world to learn from interactions and use this knowledge to obtain a certain goal.

# Application
The application of RL vary a lot ranging from 

The AI bot that plays Alpha GO

RL algorithm that plays Atari games

Teaching robots to walk 

and even self driving cars

# The Setting
In a RL environment there should be something that takes a particular decision this something is called and Agent. The Agent interacts with the environment and based on the feedback received by the environment make strategies to maximise its reward.

As an analogy we can consider our Agent to be a puppy who is new born and has only started to explore the environment. It knows that it has to follow what the owner says and when it does something right it gets a treat or a positive reinforcement or when it does something wrong it gets a negative reinforcement. It does not know how do something on its own when the owner says a command it does something randomly and the wait for the owner to give a feedback in the form or a reward based on the reward it acquires some knowledge and prepared itself for the next command.

After a lot of trial and error the puppy learns strategies to maximise the amount of treats it can get over the course of its lifetime there by understanding how to preform correctly to what its master is saying.

# Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma

## Exploration

Exploring potential hypothesis on how to perform an action.

## Exploitation

Exploring limited knowledge about what is already known to work well.

Consider a situation where our puppy learn to do 5 tricks now it is knows doing this tricks correctly will get it rewards but what if the owner gives an other command and the puppy try to do one of the five tricks this is called exploration-exploitation dilemma.
